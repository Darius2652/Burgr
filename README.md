An open-source recreation of a Burger promo site, inspired by a post on the /r/webdev subreddit.

#### Viewing / editing

Ready-to-run HTML, CSS and JS files can be found in the _Compiled_ folder for easy access.

I built the site using NodeJS, Express, SASS and Pug. To use these:

- Make sure you've got NodeJS installed
- Run `npm install` to download the necessary dependencies
- Run `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the server
- Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) using your web browser
